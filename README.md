# Lebron Monte Carlo
Ran a Monte Carlo simulation of Lebron's 2023 season
Scraped Lebron's game by game data then created a distribution of points per game based on the points data.  From there ran a monte carlo simulation with the simulation choosing a point value from the previous distribution and adding it to a predicted game log.  The number of games played in a season is randomly selected from a range between the maximum and minimum number of games Lebron has played in a season.  The simulation is run 10,000 times and the resulting graphs and averages are shown at the bottom of the file.
